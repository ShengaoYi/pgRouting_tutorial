     );
     ```

### Understanding Graphs and Networks in pgRouting

pgRouting extends the capabilities of PostGIS and PostgreSQL by providing geospatial routing functionalities. A fundamental concept to grasp in pgRouting is how it represents and works with graphs and networks.

#### How pgRouting Represents Networks

- **Graph Theory Basics**: In pgRouting, networks are modeled as graphs. A graph consists of nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) that connect these nodes.
- **Nodes**: These are typically intersections, points of interest, or termini in a road network.
- **Edges**: Represent the road segments or paths that connect nodes. Each edge has attributes such as length, cost (which could be distance, time, or other metrics), and directionality (one-way or two-way).

#### Building and Querying Network Data

1. **Creating a Topological Network**:
   - Example SQL:
     ```sql
     -- Transform the 'geom' column from EPSG:4326 (WGS 84) to EPSG:2263 (NAD83/New York Long Island) projection
     ALTER TABLE nyc_road_direction_speed
     ALTER COLUMN geom TYPE geometry(MultiLineString, 2263)
       USING ST_Transform(geom, 2263);

     -- Add columns that are typically used for graph representation in routing algorithms
      ALTER TABLE nyc_road_direction_speed
      ADD COLUMN "source" INTEGER,
      ADD COLUMN "target" INTEGER,
      ADD COLUMN cost DOUBLE PRECISION,
      ADD COLUMN reverse_cost DOUBLE PRECISION;
      
      -- Update values in the table
      -- Modify existing rows in the nyc_road_direction_speed table based on the values in the trafdir column.
      -- Set the cost column and reverse_cost column according to different conditions
      UPDATE nyc_road_direction_speed
      SET cost = CASE
              WHEN trafdir = 'FT' THEN shape_leng::double precision  -- Forward direction is passable, set cost as the shape_leng
              WHEN trafdir = 'TF' THEN -1 -- Forward direction is not passable, set a high cost
              WHEN trafdir = 'TW' THEN shape_leng::double precision -- Both directions are passable, set cost as the shape_leng
              WHEN trafdir = 'NV' THEN -1 -- Both directions are impassable, set a high cost
              ELSE -1 -- For any other value, set as impassable
          END,
          reverse_cost = CASE
              WHEN trafdir = 'FT' THEN -1 -- Reverse direction is not passable, set a high cost
              WHEN trafdir = 'TF' THEN shape_leng::double precision -- Reverse direction is passable, set cost as the shape_leng
              WHEN trafdir = 'TW' THEN shape_leng::double precision -- Both directions are passable, set cost as the shape_leng
              WHEN trafdir = 'NV' THEN -1 -- Both directions are impassable, set a high cost
              ELSE -1 -- For any other value, set as impassable
          END;
      -- The pgr_createTopology function is a part of the pgRouting extension for PostgreSQL,
      -- used to create a network topology from a road network table. 
      -- The function takes several parameters, including the name of the table 
      -- containing the road network data, tolerance value, geometry column name, and primary key column name.
         
      -- 'nyc_road_direction_speed': This is the name of the table containing the road network data.
         
      -- 0.00001: This is the tolerance value. It determines the distance within which two network nodes 
      -- will be considered equal. Nodes that are closer than this tolerance value will be snapped together 
      -- to create a network topology.
         
      -- 'geom': This is the name of the geometry column in the nyc_road_direction_speed table. 
      -- It holds the geometric information (such as LINESTRING) representing the road segments.
         
      -- 'gid': This is the primary key column in the nyc_road_direction_speed table. 
      -- It uniquely identifies each row in the table.
         
      -- When you run this query, the pgr_createTopology function will process the road network data,
      -- snap nearby nodes together based on the specified tolerance, and create a network topology suitable for 
      -- routing and analysis using pgRouting functions.
      SELECT pgr_createTopology(
         'nyc_road_direction_speed', 
         0.00001,
         'geom',
         'gid',
         'source',
         'target'
      );
     ```

2. **Preparing Data for pgRouting**:
   - Once you have your network data in the database, you need to assign source and target nodes to each edge and calculate the cost for each edge.
   ```sql
   -- The results are used to update the pickup_node and dropoff_node columns, respectively, in the taxiorder table.
   UPDATE taxiorder
   SET pickup_node = ( -- Assign a value to the pickup_node column in the taxiorder table.
     SELECT node.id 
     FROM nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr AS node -- A subquery that retrieves the id column from the nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr table aliased as node.
     ORDER BY node.the_geom <-> ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(pickup_longitude::double precision, pickup_latitude::double precision), 4326) -- Calculate the distance between the pickup location (specified by pickup_longitude and pickup_latitude) and the geometries (the_geom) in the nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr table. It orders the results by proximity, with the closest node first.
     LIMIT 1 -- Limits the result to the nearest node, ensuring that only one node is selected.
   );
   
   UPDATE taxiorder
   SET dropoff_node = (
     SELECT node.id
     FROM nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr AS node
     ORDER BY node.the_geom <-> ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(dropoff_longitude::double precision, dropoff_latitude::double precision), 4326)
     LIMIT 1
   );
     ```

Understanding how to model your data as a network in pgRouting is key to performing efficient routing queries. Each edge and node in your network can have multiple attributes that can be used in your routing algorithms, allowing for complex and real-world routing scenarios.

## Chapter 5: Advanced Topics in pgRouting

### Routing for Multiple Pairs
pgRouting offers capabilities to handle routing for multiple pairs of origins and destinations efficiently. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios like fleet management, where you need to determine optimal routes for several vehicles simultaneously.

```sql

ALTER TABLE nyc_road_direction_speed
ADD COLUMN x1 DOUBLE PRECISION,
ADD COLUMN y1 DOUBLE PRECISION,
ADD COLUMN x2 DOUBLE PRECISION,
ADD COLUMN y2 DOUBLE PRECISION;

-- Update the newly added columns (x1, y1, x2, y2) using the spatial functions ST_X and ST_Y. 
-- It updates the nyc_road_direction_speed table by matching the source and target IDs from the table 
-- with the corresponding IDs in the nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr table 
-- and extracting the X and Y coordinates for start and end points of road segments.
UPDATE nyc_road_direction_speed n
SET x1 = ST_X(sn.the_geom),
    y1 = ST_Y(sn.the_geom),
    x2 = ST_X(en.the_geom),
    y2 = ST_Y(en.the_geom)
FROM nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr sn, nyc_road_direction_speed_vertices_pgr en
WHERE n.source = sn.id
AND n.target = en.id; --Specify that the update should be performed only where the source column in the nyc_road_direction_speed table matches the id column in the sn table, and the target column in the nyc_road_direction_speed table matches the id column in the en table. This ensures that the correct spatial data is associated with the corresponding road segments in the nyc_road_direction_speed table.

-- Prepare for the order data
-- Alter the taxiorder table in the database by adding two new columns: pickup_node and dropoff_node, 
-- both of type INTEGER. 
ALTER TABLE taxiorder
ADD COLUMN pickup_node INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN dropoff_node INTEGER;


-- A function call to pgr_astar, a pgRouting function used for A* shortest path calculations.
SELECT
  o.id,
  o.pickup_node,
  o.dropoff_node,
  pgr_astar(
    'SELECT gid as id, source, target, cost, x1, y1, x2, y2 FROM nyc_road_direction_speed',
    o.pickup_node,
    o.dropoff_node,
    directed := false -- This parameter indicates that the graph is undirected, meaning that paths can be traversed in both directions
  ) as route
FROM
  taxiorder o;
```

### One-Way vs. Two-Way Streets in Routing
Routing through a network of streets requires understanding the directionality of each segment.
```sql
-- The pgr_dijkstra function is a part of the pgRouting extension for PostgreSQL and is used for 
-- finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

-- The first parameter of pgr_dijkstra is a subquery that selects the necessary columns from your road network table.
-- Here, gid is used as the ID, source and target represent the start and end nodes of each edge, 
-- cost represents the cost of moving from the source to the target node, 
-- and reverse_cost represents the cost of moving in the opposite direction.

-- The second parameter (335) represents the source node ID from which you want to find the shortest path.

-- The third parameter (796) represents the target node ID where you want the shortest path to end.

-- The directed := true argument indicates that the graph is directed. 
-- Directed graphs have edges with direction, meaning you can only travel in one direction along each edge.

-- This query will find the shortest path in the graph from node 335 to node 796 using Dijkstra's algorithm,
-- considering the provided edge costs and directions. 

-- The result will include the sequence of nodes and edges that form the shortest path, 
-- along with the total cost of the path.

SELECT
  seq,
  path_seq,
  node,
  edge,
  dijkstra.cost,
  agg_cost,
  geom
FROM pgr_Dijkstra(
  'select gid as id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost from nyc_road_direction_speed',
  335, 796, true) as dijkstra
JOIN nyc_road_direction_speed as edges
ON dijkstra.edge = edges.gid;

```

### Considering Speed Limits in Routing
Incorporating speed limits allows for routing based not just on distance, but on estimated travel time.
```sql

-- Consider speed limit
-- Add new columns for time-based cost
ALTER TABLE nyc_road_direction_speed 
ADD COLUMN time_cost DOUBLE precision,
ADD COLUMN time_reverse_cost DOUBLE PRECISION;

-- Change the speed limit 0 to 25. (In this data, 25 is the majority)
UPDATE nyc_road_direction_speed
SET postvz_sl = '25'
WHERE postvz_sl = '0';

-- Update the new columns with calculated time-based cost
-- The time_cost and time_reverse_cost columns are populated with time-based costs calculated using the formula: 
-- (length in meters) / (speed limit in miles per hour * 1609.34 meters per mile / 3600 seconds per hour). 
-- If the cost or reverse cost is greater than 0 (indicating a valid road segment), the time-based cost is 
-- calculated; otherwise, the column is set to -1.
UPDATE nyc_road_direction_speed
SET time_cost = CASE
                  WHEN cost > 0 THEN shape_leng::double precision / (postvz_sl::double precision * 1609.34 / 3600)
                  ELSE -1
                END,
    time_reverse_cost = CASE
                          WHEN reverse_cost > 0 THEN shape_leng::double precision / (postvz_sl::double precision * 1609.34 / 3600)
                          ELSE -1
                        END;
-- Use the pgr_Dijkstra function to find the shortest paths in the nyc_road_direction_speed road network. 
-- The function is provided with a SQL subquery that selects the necessary columns, including 
-- the calculated time_cost and time_reverse_cost. 
-- The function then calculates the shortest path based on these time-based costs. 
-- The first query considers the graph as directed (true), while the second query considers it as undirected (false).
 SELECT * FROM pgr_Dijkstra(
  'select gid as id, source, target, time_cost as cost, time_reverse_cost as reverse_cost from nyc_road_direction_speed',
  15916, 3253, true);

-- QGIS
-- Defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) named shortest_path.
-- CTE stands for Common Table Expression and is defined using the WITH keyword. 
-- It is a named temporary result set in a SQL query that can reference within the context of a SELECT, INSERT, 
-- UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 

WITH shortest_path AS (
    SELECT * FROM pgr_Dijkstra(
        'SELECT gid AS id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost FROM nyc_road_direction_speed',
        15916, 3253, true
    )
)
SELECT * 
FROM shortest_path
JOIN nyc_road_direction_speed AS edges
ON shortest_path.edge = edges.gid;
```

### Solving TSP in pgRouting
The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in routing and logistics.
```sql
-- Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) https://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/pgr_TSP.html
SELECT * FROM pgr_TSP(
  $$SELECT * FROM pgr_dijkstraCostMatrix(
    'SELECT gid as id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost FROM nyc_road_direction_speed',
    ARRAY[15916, 3253, 31665, 626],  -- List of node IDs to visit
    directed => false) $$); --This inner query calculates the cost matrix for the specified nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. It uses the pgr_dijkstraCostMatrix function to find the shortest paths between the specified nodes in the nyc_road_direction_speed road network. The SELECT statement creates a cost matrix based on the road network, considering both the forward and reverse costs. The ARRAY specifies the list of node IDs to visit, and directed => false indicates that the graph is undirected.
    -- This outer query solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using the TSP solver provided by pgRouting. It takes the output of the inner query (the cost matrix) as input. The pgr_TSP function finds the optimal order in which to visit the specified nodes (specified in the ARRAY) while minimizing the total travel cost based on the calculated cost matrix.

-- QGIS
WITH tsp_result AS (
  SELECT * FROM pgr_TSP(
    $$SELECT * FROM pgr_dijkstraCostMatrix(
      'SELECT gid as id, source, target, cost, reverse_cost FROM nyc_road_direction_speed',
      ARRAY[15916, 3253, 31665, 626],  -- List of node IDs to visit
      directed => false) $$
  )
), tsp_sequence AS (
  SELECT seq, node, lead(node) OVER (ORDER BY seq) AS next_node
  FROM tsp_result
  WHERE seq < (SELECT max(seq) FROM tsp_result)  -- Exclude the last node
),dijkstra_paths AS (
  SELECT 
    tsp.seq AS tsp_seq,
    dp.*
  FROM tsp_sequence tsp,
  LATERAL (
    SELECT d.* FROM pgr_dijkstra(
      'SELECT gid AS id, source, target, cost FROM nyc_road_direction_speed',
      tsp.node,
      tsp.next_node,
      directed := false
    ) AS d WHERE d.edge > -1
  ) AS dp
)SELECT * FROM dijkstra_paths
JOIN nyc_road_direction_speed as edges
ON dijkstra_paths.edge = edges.gid;

```

## Appendix B: Frequently Asked Questions
### FAQs on pgRouting
- Question: How does pgRouting handle one-way streets in routing?

  Answer: pgRouting considers one-way streets by using the reverse_cost parameter in its functions. If reverse_cost is set to a high value or -1, it indicates that the road segment cannot be traversed in the opposite direction.
- Question: What are the system requirements for pgRouting?

  Answer: pgRouting requires PostgreSQL and PostGIS to be installed. The system requirements are generally those required by these two components. A more powerful CPU and more memory can improve performance, especially for complex queries on large datasets.
